# ThoughtSpot Embedding Advanced Step-by-Step

Welcome to TSE Advanced step-by-step. This is a self-guided course that will teach you some of the advanced concepts for
embedding. Each section is broken down into a concrete topic along with instructions on the steps to follow and code
examples to let you work on the steps yourself. This course assumes you have completed either
the [instructor led](https://training.thoughtspot.com/thoughtspot-embedded-embedding-fundamentals-for-javascript-developers)
or [self-paced](https://github.com/thoughtspot/tse-fundamentals-step-by-step/blob/main/README.md) TSE Fundamentals
course.

## Requirements

This course was created using version 9.12.0.cl. Features are regularly updated, so if you are using a more recent
version, then things may have changed. Please provide feedback in the discussion or issues. You should be on a more
recent version of ThoughtSpot for some features.

## Resources and knowledge

For this tutorial you will need the following:

* A modern browser. Chrome is recommended, but not required. All examples will use Chrome.
* Access to ThoughtSpot with TSE enabled. If you don't have an account, you can create an account
  at https://thoughtspot.com/trial?tsref=dev=stepbystep.
* A code editor for editing the Javascript code. The examples will
  use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free editor that works on many operating systems.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Node Package Manager (NPS)](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install and run code.
* (Optionally) [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) command line. Git isn't required, but is recommended. And it
  comes pre-installed on macOS and Linux.
* A basic understanding of ThoughtSpot Embedding and web development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This tutorial uses [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org//)  It's not important to
understand this framework to complete the course, but it does help. All the steps and files to modify will be described as we proceed
with the course.
